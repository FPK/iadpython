"""
Class for managing integrating spheres.

This module contains the Sphere class, designed to simulate and analyze the
behavior of light within an integrating sphere. An integrating sphere is a
device used in optical measurements, which allows for the uniform scattering
of light. It is commonly used for reflection and transmission measurements
of materials.

The Sphere class models the geometrical and optical properties of an
integrating sphere, enabling the calculation of various parameters such as
the areas of spherical caps given port diameters, relative port areas,
and the gain caused by reflections within the sphere. It supports different
measurements scenarios by adjusting port diameters, detector reflectivity,
wall reflectivity, and using a reflectance standard.

Attributes:
    d_sphere (float): Diameter of the integrating sphere in millimeters.
    d_sample (float): Diameter of the port that holds the sample.
    d_empty (float): Diameter of the empty port.
    d_detector (float): Diameter of the port with the detector.
    r_detector (float): Reflectivity of the detector.
    r_wall (float): Reflectivity of the sphere's internal wall.
    r_std (float): Reflectivity of the standard used for calibration.

Methods:
    cap_area: actual area of a spherical cap for a port
    relative_cap_area: relative area of spherical cap to the sphere's area.
    gain: sphere gain relative to a black sphere
    multiplier: multiplier for wall power due to sphere

Example usage:
    >>> import iadpython
    >>> s = iadpython.Sphere(250,20)
    >>> print(s)

    >>> s = iadpython.Sphere(200, 20, d_empty=10, d_detector=10, r_detector=0.8, r_wall=0.99, r_std=0.99)
    >>> print(sphere)
    >>> area_sample = sphere.cap_area(sphere.d_sample)
    >>> print(f"Sample port area: {area_sample:.2f} mmÂ²")

    The center of the sphere is at (0,0,0)
    For a reflection measurement, the empty port is the diameter of through
    which the light enters to hit the sample.  For a transmission measurement
    this is the port that might allow unscattered transmission to leave. In
    either case, the reflectance from this port is assumed to be zero.

    Attributes:
        - d_sphere: diameter of integrating sphere [mm]
        - d_sample: diameter of the port that has the sample [mm]
        - d_empty: diameter of the empty port [mm]
        - d_detector: diameter of port with detector [mm]
        - r_detector: reflectivity of the detector
        - r_wall: reflectivity of the wall
        - r_std: reflectivity of the standard used with the sphere
